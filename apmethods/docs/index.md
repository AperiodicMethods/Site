# Aperiodic Methods Project

**This project & website are still under development.**

Welcome to the Aperiodic Methods project!

This website hosts an online version of the code and figures for the project 'Aperiodic Methods' project, which
surveys and compares available methods for measuring aperiodic activity in neural data.

## Overview

To examine these methods, we use simulated data with known aperiodic and periodic properties in order to evaluate aperiodic
methods and how they perform on neural data.

Topics include:
- Spectral Line Fitting (e.g. spectral parameterization)
- Decomposition Methods (e.g. IRASA)
- AutoCorrelation Measures
- Fluctuation Measures (e.g. Hurst Exponent, DFA)
- Complexity Measures (e.g.: fractal dimension)
- Information Theory Metrics (e.g. entropy)

Available materials are created as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), and are intended to be executed and explored in a hands-on manner.
There is a download link at the top left of the page, that can be used to download each page as a notebook.
